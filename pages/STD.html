				About The Game
			</h2>
			<p class = "aboutme">
				- Spud Tower Defence is my first attempt at making a game in Unity<br>
				- I created all the assests in the game myself in Blender<br>
				- The game is coded in C# which I have been learning while making this<br>
				- I began making the game in January 2023 and it is currently on hold<br>
				- I also created alot of 2D art for the game from menus to the HUD to icons<br>
