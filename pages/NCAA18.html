				About The Game
			</h2>
			<p class = "aboutme">
				- NCAA Basketball 18 was my first ever project for NBA 2K<br>
				- It took me nearly a year to create the first version from 2017 to 2018<br>
				- I had no idea what I was doing so was learning constantly as I progressed<br>
				- I had to research over 350 individual players to recreate them in game<br>
				- The game features 'mid-major' colleges as they had not been created before<br>
				- I recreated most of the art at a higher quality in 2020<br>
