					<h3>Personal Work</h3><br><br>
					<p>
					 I started making recording and make YouTube videos when I was 13, uploading them online to show off to friends and get views online. I used an Filmora on my phone at first but then moved to Hitfilm Express, Sony Vegas and I now use Premiere Pro.<br><br>
						I started making flash games online when I was 10 using Sploder, I then moved on to using Roblox Studio to create many games for a few years until I was 16. In Roblox I learned some basic games design, 3D Modelling and Lua scripting.<br><br>
					  I started to create mods for PC games after Roblox when I was 16 and it was here I taught myself to create textures and images using GIMP and do more advanced 3D Editing and Modelling using Blender. </p>
