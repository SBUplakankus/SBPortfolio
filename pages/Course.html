					<h3>Course Work</h3><br><br>
					<p>This year I did a Level 5 QQI Course in Games Design and Art at Kerry College. This was my first time studying in this area formally as I had always taught myself through online tutorials. I completed modules such as,<br><br>
					- Computer Illustrated Graphics<br>
					- Games Design and Analysis<br>
					- Games Design and Art<br>
					- 3D Modelling and Animation<br>
					- Digital Editing<br>
					- Web Authoring<br><br>
						
					I worked in the Adobe suite using applications such as Premiere Pro, Illustrator and Photoshop, while also creating games in software such as Scratch and the Godot Engine. Koala is one of these games which you can play below.
