				About Me
			</h2>
			<p class = "aboutme">
				My name is Se치n Burke and I am a 21 year old student, currently studying in a Level 5 QQI Games Art and Design course at Kerry College in Tralee Co.Kerry. 
				I am coming to the end of my first year of formal study in the field but I have been making games, making videos and creating digital art as a hobby for over a decade. 
				<br><br>
				I am now hoping to progress to a Level 7 or 8 course next year somewhere in Ireland. The list of places I am applying to include universities in Sligo, Carlow, Clonmel and Thurles among others. This will hopefully allow me to have a career doing what I love in Video Game Development.

				How I Got Here
			</h2>
			<p class = "aboutme">
				I've loved gaming since I was 5 years old and at 10 I created my first games using an old website called Sploder. I then moved onto Roblox where I created many games up until I was 15 using Roblox Studio. I also created my first YouTube channel at this time where I did let's plays of video games I liked, recording and editing everything on my phone.
				<br><br>
				In 2017 I started working on mods for NBA 2K games which led me to create some very large projects, taking thousands of hours to complete, but teaching me some very valuable skills and lessons. In 2022 I enrolled in a Games Design course and took my first steps into developing full games in engines such as Scratch, Godot and Unity.
